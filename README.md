# Neural-network-from-scratch
1. Training a Linear MNIST classifier using neural network and analyzing performance based on varying batch size and dataset size
2. Training a single layer neural network with quadratic and logsitic loss and analyzing respective performance. 
3. Performing data augmentation on CIFAR10 dataset using Mixup, Cutout and standard augmentation techniques.
